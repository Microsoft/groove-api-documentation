# Groove User Authentication
To use the user-authenticated APIs, you need to have an access token that authenticates
your app to a particular set of permissions for a user.

The Groove API uses the standard [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) authentication scheme to authenticate users and generate access tokens. You must provide an access token for every user-authenticated API call via the following header:

* `Authorization: Bearer {token}`

### Nota Bene
There are two distinct use cases depending on the API you are using:
- If the user must be authentified, you must send your request with a **User Authentication** token
- Otherwise, you must send your request with either an application token or a user token

For any API, you'll always need **one** (and exactly one) auth token with your request.

## Register a Microsoft Account application
To register your app to connect with Groove, you'll need a Microsoft account.

1. Go to the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://account.live.com/developers/applications)
2. When prompted, sign in with your Microsoft account credentials.
3. Find My applications and click Add an app.
4. Enter your app's name and click Create application.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and check the Live SDK support box.

After you've completed these steps, an application ID and application secret are created for your app and displayed on your new app's properties page.

**Important** Treat the value of client secret the same as you would a user's password. The secret represents the key to your application and, if made available, can be used to impersonate your application.

Under the Platforms header, configure details about your app. By default a new app is created as a web app and needs one or more redirect URIs. To enable native client flows for your app as well, click the Add Platform button and choose Mobile.

## User Authentication
The way you will implement user authentication depends on the platforms you are targeting.
* If you are building a website, see the [User Authentication on the Web](User-Authentication-on-the-Web.md) documentation
* If you are building an application, see the [User Authentication in Applications](User-Authentication-in-Applications.md) documentation
