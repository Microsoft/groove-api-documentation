# Extra parameters for Lookup API
The lookup API offers an optional query parameter **extras** that allows requesting a list of extra fields that are by default not included in the responses. Multiple values in that list must be separated with **+**. Some combinations of extras and sources are not supported, in that case the extra is ignored.

Be aware that these extras don't come for free; each of them has a negative impact on the response time of the Lookup API. Only request them if you need them.

## Possible values

| **Item type** | **"Extras" value** | **Available in data sources** | **Corresponding extra information**                                                                 |
